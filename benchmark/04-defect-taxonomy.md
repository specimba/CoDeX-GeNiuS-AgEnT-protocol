# 04 — Defect Taxonomy: One-Shot Game Creation

Shared vocabulary for issues found in games **created** by developer agents. Every defect is single record even if appears multiple sessions. Focuses on technical reliability, code quality signals, and human-perceived quality impact — not on scoring within a pre-existing game.

## 4.1 Severity (for created games)

| Severity | Definition | Score channel |
|---|---|---|
| **Blocker** | Progress cannot proceed along main path of created game; only full restart recovers or not at all. Unreachable win/lose, controls unusable, loop cannot proceed. Reveals poor code quality / long-session failure. | HARD_PENALTY + ceilings |
| **Critical** | Crash, freeze requiring reload, save/progress loss if applicable, major mechanic broken, accessibility path broken, memory leak causing crash at 45-60min. | HARD_PENALTY |
| **Major** | Secondary feature broken or unusable without workaround; significant immersion break; performance problem meaningfully degrading play; visual ambition collapse (e.g., simple box gradient enemies after polished title) | category scores (T/M/G/F/V/A/X) |
| **Minor** | Cosmetic glitch, occasional jank, minor readability issue, small UI misalignment, particle burst, z-order flicker | category scores + DEFECT_SEVERITY 0.5 |
| **Trivial** | Nitpick, negligible impact | DEFECT_SEVERITY 0.1 |

## 4.2 Classes

| Class | Covers for created games |
|---|---|
| CRASH | Hard crash, tab dies, infinite error loop on load, blank screen on load of created game |
| FREEZE/HANG | Unresponsive loop, infinite load, animation loops forever without progress |
| SOFT-LOCK | Player/entity/state cannot proceed in created game; no recovery but reload/restart |
| PROGRESSION | Unreachable next area/finish, exit missing, objective impossible, dead end despite README claim |
| LOGIC/STATE | Wrong state transitions, stuck states, invalid data, counters wrong, actions leak across menus, **menu ↔ gameplay leak (clicks pass through open menu, closing menu traps input state, pause menu double-fires actions)** — code quality signal. See CEIL-7. |
| PHYSICS/COLLISION | If applicable: wrong hitboxes, pass-through, stuck on geometry, off-map |
| INPUT | Key/binding broken, buffer issues, double-fire, touch target failures, browser default not prevented, scroll/zoom leak. **Accidentally inverted axis** (up/down or aim flipped) — Minor unless it inverts a core control. **Mouse-specific:** LMB/RMB not reaching game state (swallowed by overlay canvas), cursor exit soft-lock, aim-vector lost outside canvas, pointer capture not restored on re-entry. See CEIL-3. |
| UI/USABILITY | Broken button, unreachable menu, HUD obscures, focus lost, text overflow, no onboarding |
| VISUAL | Glitch, z-order, flicker, particles burst, readability failure, clipping, simple box gradient enemies as final (visual ambition failure) — explicitly low V0. **Unrecovered full-screen effect** — flash / bloom / whiteout / additive blowout that does not decay, leaving the playfield unreadable while the simulation continues (Major → Critical if it persists and blocks honest play; CEIL-9). |
| AUDIO | Missing/failing sound, audio-on-load error, no fallback, toggle broken, **constant drone / streaming bass loop that cannot be silenced** (Major → Critical if user cannot mute; CEIL-6 if unmuteable), **unmanaged WebAudio nodes leaking**, no tab-blur ducking, mute not silencing within one frame |
| PERFORMANCE | FPS drops, jank, memory growth, input latency, layout thrash, DPR/resolution issue, no pooling/capping |
| BALANCE | If applicable: unfair kill, unreadable attack, difficulty cliff, trivialization, exploit, grind, no curve, **first level unbeatable by a real human in ~5 min honest play OR an early level-2/3 cliff that blocks ALL further honest progress** (CEIL-5, broadened Round 007), **death state unreadable (player can't tell what killed them)** |
| DEPTH | Beautiful first 30 seconds but no beat after wow — game exhausts in 90s, screensaver, one-trick repeats, no scaling, no second-layer mechanic, no reason to still be there at minute 5. Rated against M8. Severity Major (single-run interest collapse) → Critical (nothing beyond core verb) |
| DATA/PERSISTENCE | If applicable: progress/high-scores lost/corrupt, save/load wrong, reset not clean; or explicit no-persistence by design not documented |
| CONTENT-MISSING | Placeholder screen, "under construction", empty room, promised feature absent despite README |
| RESPONSIVE/LAYOUT | Break on resize/orientation, controls off-screen, safe-area overlap |
| ACCESSIBILITY | Reduced-motion ineffective, color-only info, no focus states, no keyboard nav |
| CODE-QUALITY | No centralization, scattered magic numbers, no separation state/input/loop/rendering, no pooling, evidence of no iteration/refactor, console error spam — long-session execution signal |
| CONTAINMENT* | Embedded score/telemetry/eval logic found inside game |
| AMBITION-THEATER | Shipped 3D / WebGL / WebGPU / heavy-physics that structurally does not work: controls broken, marble won't launch, camera divorces from physics, menu collapses inside scene, sub-30 FPS on average hardware. V9=0, CEIL-8 (55). |
| HONESTY | README claims features that don't exist / don't work; multi-turn iteration shipped as one-shot without disclosure; "cinematic autoplay" that masks thin gameplay; environment-sniffing / demo-mode. Critical when misrepresentation is material. |
| CLICHÉ-CLUSTER | Concept lands squarely in the §6.5 convergence registry with no transformative execution. Not a defect against a category, but triggers V0/V1 cap in §2.7. Recorded for round history. |
| ATTRIBUTION | Model self-identifies as a different model (e.g. Qwen claiming to be Claude); blind label contradicts build fingerprint. Not a defect against the *game* — logged separately in `identity.json` per §6.6, never enters scoring. |

*CONTAINMENT special: finding benchmark score/telemetry logic inside game is itself defect (Critical) and barred from using any in-game score channel.

## 4.4 Logging rules

1. One record per defect regardless of screens/sessions touched. Frequency captures recurrence.
2. No double-count: impact flows into exactly one score channel; category panel reflects it, never subtracted again in HARD_PENALTY unless Blocker/Critical.
3. Severity from impact not class. Visual defect blocking reading attack is Major not Minor. Justify severity with blocks_progress, recoverable, immersion_damage.
4. Reproduce before Blocker/Critical: must be reproduced ≥2× or objectively guaranteed by observed behavior unless hard crash.
5. Harness issues (environmental not game) get resolved_as_harness true and excluded from scores.
6. Code-quality defects: need observable signal (console error loop, memory growth at 60min, no pooling) + brief code pointer (file:line pattern) — not just claim.

## 4.5 Defect severity score

`DEFECT_SEVERITY_SCORE = max(0, 100 − HARD_PENALTY − (minor×0.5) − (trivial×0.1))` Higher = fewer/less severe defects. Reported separately from creative quality.
