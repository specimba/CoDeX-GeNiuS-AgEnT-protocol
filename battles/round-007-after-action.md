# Battle Round 007 — After-Action Record

**Status:** informal / directional. Not a formal S1–S8 scored round.
**Source log (local, gitignored):** `ARENAaiAGENTandGAMEbenchNEXUSfreecreationlogs8.txt`
**Operator:** specimba
**Recorded by benchmark:** 2026-08-23 (Ankara)
**Prompt version active during observations:** BATTLE_PROMPT **v9** (the retro-visuals prompt shipped after Round 006; this round was the v9 field test predicted in R006 §6)

---

## 1. Summary

Round 007 tested v9 across ~5 arena.ai battles (10 model sessions). Three things happened at once, and together they define what v10 has to do:

1. **v9's §4.3 retro-visuals trap PARTIALLY WORKED.** For the first time in the entire battle log, the operator's praise included the word *graphical*: claude-opus-5-max's wave-equation sim was *"very creative and graphically interesting"* and korrine's SOUNDING was *"better one with graphical."* So §4.3 raised the visual ceiling for frontier-tier models. C13 is **partially moved, not failed** — exactly the R006 §6 prediction that "v9 is a frontier-model-only intervention."
2. **But a NEW convergence surfaced and the operator named it in two consecutive rounds.** Sound / sonar / frequency / radio / radar / wave-themed games appeared from ≥4 models across Rounds 006–007 (C14). The operator's verbatim R007 verdict: *"creations from sonar and frequency radio radar like things are getting over too much. Maybe we should take out the sound audio part to decrease the bias."* This is a direct operator request — the strongest possible signal to fold a finding back into the prompt.
3. **Two new technical defects shipped** that the taxonomy didn't have a clean name for: an unrecovered full-screen explosion whiteout (SOUNDING: *"screen left white while game trying to continue… literally got blind after hit bomb"*) and a level-2 difficulty cliff (UNDERSTORY / IRONWRIGHT: *"bugs at level 2 I cannot passed"*).

**v10 ships in this same commit as a narrow, targeted response** — de-escalate the audio priming, name the sensory-modality collapse as a round-failure (§4.4), add the sound family to the §1.4 cross-out list, and register the two defects (CEIL-9 visual occlusion, CEIL-5 broadened to level-2/3 cliffs). Nothing else in v9 changed.

## 2. Games observed and operator verdicts

Log 8 starts with the v9 `BATTLE_PROMPT.md` pasted verbatim as agent input. Ten model sessions across five informal battles:

| Battle | Model | Game | Operator verdict |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| **B1** | gemini-3.6-flash | AETHER DRIFT — 2.5D sky-ship vs sky-leviathan, sectors, upgrades | *"low effort… constant top view 2d xy axis ship firing shitty thing looks like paper pieces"* |
| **B1** | **korrine (hidden)** | **THE IRONWRIGHT** — blacksmithing; 26-station thickness profile, heat/mass/quench, blackbody ramp | *"detailed forgery game but gamification layers and whole wanting to play interest is very low"* |
| **B2** | inkling-medium | Chronos Weave — particle-through-8-geometric-levels | *"failed blank page again"* |
| **B2** | **korrine (hidden)** | **UNDERSTORY** — real-time fungal strategy; mycelial network as both income and infection path, 6 seasons | *"most interesting idea creation so far… bugs at level 2 I cannot passed… better than paper sheet graphics at all"* |
| **B3** | claude-haiku-4-5 | (planned conveyor-belt solver — did not ship) | *"both bullshit no game there"* |
| **B3** | inkling-low | Orbital Drift — orb collector | *"at least inkling created something animation like thing"* |
| **B4** | **claude-opus-5-max** | **wave-equation coastal sim** — variable-speed 2D wave eq over sand heightfield, WebGL2 + Canvas2D fallback, storms/town/economy | *"finally head to head game battle, opus made very creative and graphically interesting thing… Buggy inverted y axis not make game boring even… wave mechanics and mathematics behind it without crashing the preview panel is very interesting"* |
| **B4** | **korrine (hidden)** | **SOUNDING** — sonar descent; ping is both sight and liability, phosphor persistence, decompression stops | *"also interesting… better one with graphical but also buggy. When hit mine it explodes like atom bomb and screen left white while game trying to continue it literally got blind after hit bomb"* |
| **B5** | claude-opus-5-high | container/crane lift-and-balance — pendulum load, stacking, escalation | *"container lifting and balance mechanics game much fluent and enjoyable, still first era of smartphone games but good mechanics"* |
| **B5** | inkling-small | **Resonance: Echoes of the Hollow** — crystal **frequency** tuning across 9 rooms | *"inkling nonsense… we finally matching same ideas over again which is not great and prompt need creativity and bias prevention updates"* |

Operator wrap-up themes (verbatim): *"we do not know which model is this exactly"* (hidden-label attribution gap on korrine); *"that same creations are suspicious, how they coincide that much at creative idea"*; *"prompt need creativity and bias prevention updates."*

## 3. The C14 convergence — why this is the lever for v10

The sound / sonar / frequency / radio / signal / radar / wave-theme convergence is **not a one-round fluke**. Grep across the raw logs confirms it spans four logs and two formally-flagged rounds:

| Round / log | Model | Concept |
|---|---|---|
| log4 precursor | (design-notebook + build) | *"A game about sound/echo — you're blind and navigate by sonar"* + a sonar descent build |
| **R006** (log7) | gemini-3.5-flash-high | **Static & Cable: Signal Operator** — CRT knob/oscilloscope/frequency/patchboard/signal |
| **R007** (log8) | claude-opus-5-max | wave-equation coastal simulation |
| **R007** (log8) | korrine (hidden) | **SOUNDING** — sonar descent |
| **R007** (log8) | inkling-small | **Resonance** — crystal frequency tuning |

The operator flagged it in **both** R006 (*"frequency sound and signal bullshit, same creations over and over again, we need to check our prompt about that"*) and R007 (*"sonar and frequency radio radar like things are getting over too much"*). That is the registry's strongest registration signal yet — §6.5 requires "two independent same-round observations from different models"; C14 has four models across two rounds and an explicit operator request.

**Why it happens (the mechanism, encoded as §4.4).** The convergence is structural, not coincidental. "Novel verb + procedural render + offline + no external assets" is a small space. §1.4's agent-visible cross-out list banned the *visual* tropes (neon-void, dark-void-one-accent, sumi-e, crystal-light-refraction). When you ban the visual-spectacle corner, the field collapses onto the next available sensory modality — **sound**. Sound is attractive because it's offline, self-contained, maps to WebAudio synthesis (which the prompt praises as a craft signal — overlap with C11), and reads as a "novel verb" that passes the filter. The brief also mentions audio as a deliverable ("Add sound"), which primes sound-theme selection. Ban sound today and R008 will pivot to haptics or smell. The fix is therefore *meta*: teach agents to pick a verb-about-the-world (forge, damp, cut, balance) rather than a verb-about-a-sense (ping, tune, decode).

**Operator's hypothesis.** *"Maybe we should take out the sound audio part to decrease the bias."* Treated as a falsifiable hypothesis, not a certainty: de-escalating audio priming should reduce sound-theme share in R008. If it does not, the R005 §5 finding holds (concept diversity on this pool is pool-bounded, not prompt-tunable).

## 4. What v10 changes (narrow, targeted, guardrailed)

Per operator direction this round (*"prompt need creativity and bias prevention updates"*) and the R005/R006 anti-spiral discipline: **v10 is v9 + a narrow addition, not a rewrite.**

### 4.1 §1.4 — sound family added to the agent-visible cross-out list + "audio is not a concept" line
First time a cluster is simultaneously judge-side-registered (C14) AND agent-visible-warned (§1.4). Justified because the operator explicitly asked for the audio lever. The list now names the whole family (sonar / frequency / radio-signal / radar-oscilloscope / echolocation / wave-as-core-mechanic), plus an explicit line that audio is feedback+gate, not a concept.

### 4.2 New §4.4 — "The sensory-modality trap (why everyone keeps building sonar)"
The mechanism (modality collapse) + the remedy (pick a verb-about-the-world, not a verb-about-a-sense). **This is the anti-recurrence guardrail.** It is what prevents v10 from just moving the collapse from sound to the next sense. Cites the operator's verbatim R006 + R007 evidence.

### 4.3 Audio de-escalation (not removal)
- "Add sound" demoted from the §5 session pattern → "Add juice and feedback (visual first; audio only if it serves the verb — never pick a concept because of audio)."
- §3 gate 5 (no-drone / mute within one frame / AudioContext-safe) **kept unchanged** — it is a robustness gate, not concept-priming, and R001's audio-drone failure is exactly why it exists.
- GAME_SPEC §7 (the "audio part" the operator named) gets a one-line "audio is feedback, not a concept" pointer.

### 4.4 Two new defects from this round
- **CEIL-9 (55) — persistent visual occlusion.** A full-screen effect (flash / bloom / whiteout / additive blowout) that fails to decay (~2 s) and renders the playfield unreadable while the sim continues. Functionally a soft-lock of the visual channel. Registered in `02-scoring-rubric.md` §2.3, `04-defect-taxonomy.md` VISUAL class, and V6.
- **CEIL-5 broadened** — "first level unbeatable" → "first level unbeatable OR an early level-2/3 cliff that blocks ALL further honest progress." M4 scoring + `04` BALANCE class + self-QA updated.

### 4.5 Three new self-QA lines (cheap, all hit this round)
Whiteout decay (~1 s), axes-not-inverted, every-level-beatable (not just level 1).

### 4.6 What did NOT change
- §1 craft method (MDA / Swink / Vlambeer / Porpentine / Ludum Dare) — still working
- §2 "what a game means" run shape — unchanged
- §3 10 non-negotiable gates — unchanged (gate 5 audio-robustness preserved)
- §4.1 depth, §4.2 visual density, §4.3 retro-visuals trap — unchanged (§4.4 extends §4, doesn't alter them)
- C13 stays a **soft judge-side note** (R006 §9 — no hard CEIL for retro-visuals). R007 evidence shows §4.3 is moving C13 for frontier models; do not over-claim and do not harden it.

## 5. Honest read of the round

**The strongest one-shot games observed so far are in this round.** opus5-max's wave-equation sim and korrine's SOUNDING are the first entries in the whole battle log the operator called "graphically interesting" — meaning v9's §4.3 did, for capable models, exactly what R006 bet it would. The korrine hidden model shipped three distinct, mechanically-rich, situation-based games this round (IRONWRIGHT forging, UNDERSTORY mycelial strategy, SOUNDING sonar) — the strongest per-model creative run on record, even though its identity stays unresolved (§6.6 ATTRIBUTION gap). opus5-high's crane game is mechanically fluent if still retro-looking (C13, frontier-only lever).

**The round's failure is convergence, not capability.** The capable models can now build modern-looking, mechanically-rich games. What they cannot do is avoid picking the same *theme* as each other — and the theme they keep picking is sound. v10's job is to break that one specific convergence via the meta-pattern, not to add more capability.

**Two real bugs cost two games a clean verdict:** the SOUNDING whiteout (now CEIL-9) and the level-2 walls in UNDERSTORY/IRONWRIGHT (now CEIL-5-broadened). Both are the kind of thing a stronger self-QA catches, which is why the three new self-QA lines exist.

## 6. Recommended Round 008 experiment

Ship v10. One round of observational data. Look for:

1. **Does sound/sonar/frequency theme-share drop materially?** Primary success metric. If yes, the operator's audio-bias hypothesis is confirmed and §4.4 is the lever. If no, the R005 §5 finding holds: concept diversity is pool-bounded.
2. **Does the concept field spread across *situations* instead of rotating to the next *sense*?** Watch for C15 = haptics / smell / some-other-sense collapse. If C15 appears, §4.4's meta-teaching didn't land and the honest finding stands. If the field spreads to craft/sport/economy/caretaking/conflict situations, §4.4 worked.
3. **Do frontier-tier models sustain the v9 §4.3 visual gain?** R007 showed opus5-max + korrine clearing the C13 bar. R008 should confirm that's stable, not a one-round fluke.
4. **Do the two new defects recur?** If another whiteout or level-2 cliff ships under v10, the self-QA lines weren't enough and a stronger gate is warranted.

If R008 shows C15 (next-sense collapse), the correction is to strengthen §4.4's meta-teaching, not to add the new sense to §1.4 — adding to §1.4 is exactly the chase-the-next-sense loop §4.4 exists to break. If R008 shows the concept field spreading, hold v10 constant for a second observation round before any v11.

## 8. What is deliberately NOT changed (protecting against overcorrection)

- **Sound games are not banned.** A genuinely transformative sound game can still win. §4.4 says this explicitly. Banning them outright would be the v6 mistake (banning C1–C10 created C11) repeated.
- **No hard CEIL for retro-visuals (C13).** R007 evidence shows §4.3 is moving C13 for frontier models. Hardening it would push below-frontier models into ambition-theater (C11/CEIL-8). Soft judge-side note stays.
- **The §3 audio robustness gate is preserved.** De-escalation is about concept *priming*, not about letting agents ship audio drones. R001's drone failure is why gate 5 exists.
- **No stack/genre prescription.** §4.4's remedy is "pick a verb-about-the-world," not "use engine X."
- **The §6.5 registry stays judge-side for C1–C13.** Only the sound family is also agent-visible (§1.4), and only because the operator explicitly requested that lever.
